    "\n",
    "There are two steps in this framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-training\n",
    "The BERT model is trained on unblabeled data over different pre-training tasks. This is how the BERT architecture understands the language and context.\n",
    "It accomplishes this in two ways:\n",
    "- Masked Languaged Model (MLM)\n",
    "    - This just masks words and attempts to predict what word would fit in the masked term.\n",
    "    - Original Sentence: \"Make sure to like and subscribe!\"\n",
    "    - Masking: \"Make sure to <b>[MASK1]</b> and <b>[MASK2]</b>\"\n",
    "    - The Model then attempts to predict what the <b>[MASK1]</b> and <b>[MASK2]</b> by plugging in terms.\n",
    "- Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\n",
    "    - Similarly to the MLM process, the NSP process attempts to predict the next sentence. (and if the next sentence is actually what it is said to be)\n",
    "    - Original Sentences: \n",
    "        - <b> Prior Sentence </b>: \"Make sure to like and subscribe!\"\n",
    "        - <b> Post Sentence </b>: \"I just hit the like button with notificatons and subscribe button!\"\n",
    "    - Does the post sentence follow the prior sentence?\n",
    "    \n",
    "In industry, you will typically utilize an already existing BERT model that has an already pretrained corpus with its distinct vocabulary and either use the model out of the box or go straght to the fine-tuning phase with your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview for pre-training:\n",
    "- Train BERT using NSP and MLM\n",

    "    - Incorporate the segment and positional embeddings to account for ordering of inputs\n",

    "    - Outputs word vectors for MLM and a binary value for NSP\n",
    "    - Word vectors passed into a Softmax Layer with X neurons, where X = number of possible words in vocab\n",

    "\n",
    "### Fine-Tuning\n",
    "The BERT model is initialized with the pre-trained parameters and then <b> all </b> the parameters are fine-tuned with labeled data. This is where the model utilizes the underlying understanding of language and context to attempt to solve a problem.\n",
    "- Replace the output layer of BERT with a fully connected network layer where the number of neurons is the number of words for prediction (for QA type problems); the number of neurons can vary among what type of problem you are attempting to solve.\n",
    "- This process is relatively fast to train since the only parameters that will be updated are the output layer parameters\n",
