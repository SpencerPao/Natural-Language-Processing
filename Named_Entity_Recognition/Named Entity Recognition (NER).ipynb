    "# What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?\n",
    "Named entity recognition models are pre-trained models on a specific corpus that has already trained labels that can act as categories for labeled text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be as simple as identifying if a label of text represents a person. For instance, high profile figures such as __Abraham Lincoln, FDR, or George Washington__ can be labeled as a __person__. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many extensions of what NER can do for you but overall you can think of this as a tool to help extract categories of text without manually extracting information using customized regex functions or rules-based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "SpaCy is an excellent NLP library for NER; documentation can be found [here](https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer)"
